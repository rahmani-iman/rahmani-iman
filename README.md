## Hi, I'm Iman 👋  
Front-End Developer focused on building scalable, maintainable web applications.

### What I do
- Build production-grade UIs using **React, Next.js, and TypeScript**
- Manage server state with **TanStack Query (React Query)**
- Handle complex client state using **Redux Toolkit**
- Develop data-heavy interfaces with **AG Grid**
- Design consistent UI systems with **Tailwind CSS & Ant Design**
- Focus on **performance, clean architecture, and long-term maintainability**

### Tech Stack
- **Frameworks:** React, Next.js  
- **Language:** TypeScript  
- **Server State:** TanStack Query (React Query)  
- **Client State:** Redux Toolkit  
- **UI:** Tailwind CSS, Ant Design  
- **Data Grids:** AG Grid  
- **Tools:** Git, REST APIs

### How I work
- Separate **server state** from **client state** intentionally  
- Prefer declarative data fetching over manual state handling  
- Optimize for readability before premature abstraction  
- Document decisions and trade-offs when they matter
